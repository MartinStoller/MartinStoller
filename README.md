### Hi there, I´m Martin 👋
In 2020 I wrote my first line of code and immediatly fell in love with the world of programming. In my freetime I love to play around with Machine Learning (classical data prediction & gameplaying agents - not so much the NLP stuff) and learn all about the world of Data Science and Data Engineering.

I started out as Java / Python Backend Dev, but quickly transitioned and specialized over the years in Data Engineering & building high-throughput OLAP Systems.
