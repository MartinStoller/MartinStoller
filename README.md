### Hi there, iÂ´m Martin ðŸ‘‹
In 2020 I wrote my first line of code and immediatly fell in love with the world of programming. In my freetime I love to play around and learn all about the world of Machine Learning. Whenever I finish one of my recreational projects, I like to summarize them in a video and upload it to my small [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq1NfsnK6fKMFnBOQfNLsCw). Feel free to check it out!

In December 2021 I landed my first Software Dev job (Java Fullstack).

In my freetime:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on A.I. learning to play different videogames through various learning techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning more about advanced reinforcement learning techniques and LSTM implementation. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting started with Cheat Engine and how to use it in order to retrieve data from games in real time.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Before getting into programming, I used to be a professional Poker player.
