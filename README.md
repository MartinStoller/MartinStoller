Hi, I’m Martin 👋

I’m a Data Engineer with a background in Java and Python backend development, specializing in building high-throughput, data-intensive systems.

I started coding in 2020 and quickly fell in love with programming. I enjoy diving deep into modern data architectures, Data Science and building all kinds of stuff in the digital world.

If you’re curious about how I think and build, check out my blog:
