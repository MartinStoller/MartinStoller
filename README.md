### Hi there, i´m Martin 👋
In 2020 I wrote my first line of code and immediatly fell in love with the world of programming. In my freetime I love to play around and learn all about the world of Machine Learning. Whenever I finish one of my recreational projects, I like to summarize them in a video and upload it to my small youtube channel. [Feel free to check it out: ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq1NfsnK6fKMFnBOQfNLsCw).

In December 2021 I landed my first Software Dev job. I mostly work with Java Fullstack there on always changing topics.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on A.I. learning to play different videogames through various learning techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Java Fullstack and several Machine Learning based topics.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on learning more about advanced reinforcement learning techniques and LSTM implementation. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting started with Cheat Engine.
