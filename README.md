### Hi there, iÂ´m Martin ðŸ‘‹
In 2020 I wrote my first line of code and immediatly fell in love with the world of programming. In my freetime I love to play around and learn all about the world of Machine Learning & Data Science. 

In 2021 I landed my first Software-Dev job (Java Fullstack) and slowly transitioned into more datadriven topics over the following years. My current role is Data Engineer. I even have a public repo on here, where i documented my learning path from Software Dev to Data Engineer. Feel free to check it out :)

In my freetime:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on A.I. learning to play different videogames through various learning techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning more about advanced reinforcement learning techniques
