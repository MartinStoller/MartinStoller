### Hi there, iÂ´m Martin ðŸ‘‹
In 2020 I wrote my first line of code and immediatly fell in love with the world of programming. In my freetime I love to play around and learn all about the world of Machine Learning. 

In December 2021 I landed my first Software-Dev job (Java Fullstack) and slowly transitioned into ETL/Datadriven topics over the following years.

In my freetime:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on A.I. learning to play different videogames through various learning techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning more about advanced reinforcement learning techniques
